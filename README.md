# Stock_Wave_Analysis
C# WinForms app for stock analysis with candlestick charts, peak/valley detection, wave construction, Fibonacci levels, and real-time simulation. Includes interactive wave selection, confirmations, and ABBV (Feb 2021) as default startup.

## 📌 Overview
A Windows Forms application for **stock data analysis**.  
It visualizes candlestick charts, detects peaks and valleys, constructs waves, and applies Fibonacci retracements with real-time confirmations.  

## ✨ Features
- Load OHLCV stock data from CSV files.  
- Candlestick + volume charting with data binding.  
- Peak/valley detection and wave construction (UP/DOWN).  
- Interactive wave selection with rubber-banding.  
- Real-time Fibonacci levels (100–0%).  
- Display of confirmations and counts.  
- Wave simulation with Start/Stop, “+” and “–” step controls.  
- Default startup: **ABBV Daily, Feb 2021**.  

## 🛠️ Tech
- **Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** Windows Forms (WinForms)  
- **Charts:** System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization  

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo.  
2. Place stock `.csv` files in a folder named **Stock Data**.  
3. Run the solution in Visual Studio.  
4. The app loads ABBV Daily (Feb 2021) by default—use controls to explore further.  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates building a **technical analysis tool** in C# with charting, algorithmic detection, and interactive simulations for financial data.
